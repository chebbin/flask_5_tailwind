#### However, the movie is not embedded in the website. If you click on the small icon that says image, you can open it in another tab.
#### I don't know why this is how it worked, and I don't know how to fix it so that it is embedded. 
#### I did both the picture and the movie to make sure I was doing it correctly.

#### 11/9- As per our conversation, the formatting of the movie did not allow it to embed in the website
#### correctly. Rather than using a .mov file an .mp4 file needed to be used. We agreed that I would not need to go
#### through the steps again as I had already stopped the CDN. Thank you!
